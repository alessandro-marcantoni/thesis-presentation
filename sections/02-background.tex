\section{Background \& Motivations}

\subsection{Multi-Agent Systems}
\begin{frame}{Multi-Agent Systems}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The reference model used for designing and implementing complex IoT systems is represented by \textbf{Multi-Agent Systems} (MAS).
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    \begin{block}{Multi-Agent System}
        A MAS consists of multiple decision-making agents interacting in a shared environment to achieve common or conflicting goals.~\cite{turing}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Multi-Agent Oriented Programming}
        MAOP is an approach to programming MAS that promotes the use of three first-class programming abstractions: the \textbf{agent} dimension, the \textbf{environment} dimension, and the \textbf{organization} dimension.~\cite{boissier2020multi}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The JaCaMo Framework}
    \begin{block}{What is JaCaMo?}
        It is an open-source MAS technology supporting the integration of tools and languages for programming the three dimensions of MAOP.~\cite{boissier2020multi}
    \end{block}

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The tool that enables the design of the \textbf{organization} dimension is represented by \moise{}.
        \item \moise{} lets users define organizations through the following abstractions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{structural} abstraction
            \item \emph{functional} abstraction
            \item \emph{normative} abstraction
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Visual Programming for MAS}
\begin{frame}{Visual Programming for MAS}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The effort to provide users with intuitive tools to design and implement MAS began with the implementation of a block-based visual programming language for agents.~\cite{burattini2022agent}
        \vspace{0.5cm}
        \item However, when dealing with complex systems where \textbf{interaction} and \textbf{coordination} between agents are crucial, handling these aspects inside the agents makes the design of the system exponentially complex.
        \vspace{0.5cm}
        \item Therefore, the next step is to provide users with a visual programming paradigm that supports the design of the \textbf{organization} of the MAS and is compatible with \moise{}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
