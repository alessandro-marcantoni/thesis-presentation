    \begin{itemize}
        \item The work culminated with the creation of a \textbf{Web IDE prototype} for the creation and \textbf{enforcement at runtime} of MAS organizations with a \textbf{visual language}
        \vspace{1cm}
        \item This project opens many possible directions for future works:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Refinement of the visual language
            \item Exploration of other technologies
            \item Monitoring of the runtime state of the organizations
            \item Achievement of \emph{self-organization} and \emph{re-organization}
